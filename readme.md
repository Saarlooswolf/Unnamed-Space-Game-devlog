## Game plan summary
This Unnamed Space Building Game is going to be a building/survival game. I plan to add some sort of a storyline but I want the player to still be able to build freely. The story will be more of something to do if the player wants a progression to beat the game. So you will still be able to play your save after the story is done. Almost like how Minecraft works.

The game will be multiplayer, so you can build/survive with your friends (or complete strangers). You will be able to build ships with interiors that you can walk around in. You will also be able to build bases on planets, or space stations orbiting around the planet. I also plan to add weapons that you can use to fight with AI or other players.

There will be AI pirates that you will need to defend against. They will fly ships around and sometimes they will try to attack your base, station, or ships. The piratesâ€™ difficulty will depend on how powerful the player is, so if you(or most of the players near you) are just starting, the pirates will have less powerful weapons and be lighter armored then a group of or an individual player who has been playing and building for a few hours.

I have no planned release date, alpha versions will be released when they are playable.
